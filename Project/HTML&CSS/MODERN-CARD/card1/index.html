            <h2>GOJO SATORU</h2>
            <p>Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.

            <br>

            Gojo's most powerful techniques include the Limitless, Six Eyes, Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue, Cursed Technique Reversal: Red, Unlimited Void, and Hollow Technique: Purple, which manipulate space, amplify cursed techniques, and have destructive and erasing capabilities.
